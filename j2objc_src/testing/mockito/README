This package creates an Objective-C library that support tests that use
Mockito (https://code.google.com/p/mockito/). Source files in this project
are those that were modified from the Mockito distribution; the others are
extracted from the source distribution when building.

Modifications:
  Added a mock maker that works with iOS and Mac OS X.
  Modified ClassPathLoader to load the iOS mock maker by default.
  Stubbed out unused ASM and Cglib classes, removed use of Objenesis,
    since iOS doesn't support bytecode.
