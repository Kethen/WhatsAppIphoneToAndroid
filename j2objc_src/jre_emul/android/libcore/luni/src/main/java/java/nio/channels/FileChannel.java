/**
 * An abstract channel type for interaction with a platform file.
 * <p>
 * A {@code FileChannel} defines the methods for reading, writing, memory
 * mapping, and manipulating the logical state of a platform file. This type
 * does not have a method for opening files, since this behavior has been
 * delegated to the {@link java.io.FileInputStream},
 * {@link java.io.FileOutputStream} and {@link java.io.RandomAccessFile} types.
 * <p>
 * FileChannels created from a {@code FileInputStream} or a
 * {@code RandomAccessFile} created in mode "r", are read-only. FileChannels
 * created from a {@code FileOutputStream} are write-only. FileChannels created
 * from a {@code RandomAccessFile} created in mode "rw" are read/write.
 * FileChannels created from a {@code RandomAccessFile} that was opened in
 * append-mode will also be in append-mode -- meaning that each write will be
 * proceeded by a seek to the end of file.
 * <p>
 * FileChannels have a virtual pointer into the file which is referred to as a
 * file <em>position</em>. The position can be manipulated by moving it
 * within the file, and the current position can be queried.
 * <p>
 * FileChannels also have an associated <em>size</em>. The size of the file
 * is the number of bytes that it currently contains. The size can be
 * manipulated by adding more bytes to the end of the file (which increases the
 * size) or truncating the file (which decreases the size). The current size can
 * also be queried.
 * <p>
 * FileChannels have operations beyond the simple read, write, and close. They
 * can also:
 * <ul>
 * <li>request that cached data be forced onto the disk,</li>
 * <li>lock ranges of bytes associated with the file,</li>
 * <li>transfer data directly to another channel in a manner that has the
 * potential to be optimized by the platform,</li>
 * <li>memory-mapping files into NIO buffers to provide efficient manipulation
 * of file data,</li>
 * <li>read and write to the file at absolute byte offsets in a fashion that
 * does not modify the current position.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * FileChannels are thread-safe. Only one operation involving manipulation of
 * the file position may be executed at the same time. Subsequent calls to such
 * operations will block, and one of those blocked will be freed to continue
 * when the first operation has completed. There is no ordered queue or fairness
 * applied to the blocked threads.
 * <p>
 * It is undefined whether operations that do not manipulate the file position
 * will also block when there are any other operations in-flight.
 * <p>
 * The logical view of the underlying file is consistent across all FileChannels
 * and I/O streams opened on the same file by the same VM.
 * Therefore, modifications performed via a channel will be visible to the
 * stream and vice versa; this includes modifications to the file position,
 * content, size, etc.
