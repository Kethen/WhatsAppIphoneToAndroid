/**
 * Represents a string under the rules of a specific {@code Collator} object.
 * Comparing two {@code CollationKey} instances returns the relative order of
 * the strings they represent.
 * <p>
 * Since the rule set of collators can differ, the sort orders of the same
 * string under two different {@code Collator} instances might differ. Hence
 * comparing collation keys generated from different {@code Collator} instances
 * can give incorrect results.
 * <p>
 * Both the method {@code CollationKey.compareTo(CollationKey)} and the method
 * {@code Collator.compare(String, String)} compares two strings and returns
 * their relative order. The performance characteristics of these two approaches
 * can differ.
 * <p>
 * During the construction of a {@code CollationKey}, the entire source string
 * is examined and processed into a series of bits terminated by a null, that
 * are stored in the {@code CollationKey}. When
 * {@code CollationKey.compareTo(CollationKey)} executes, it performs bitwise
 * comparison on the bit sequences. This can incur startup cost when creating
 * the {@code CollationKey}, but once the key is created, binary comparisons
 * are fast. This approach is recommended when the same strings are to be
 * compared over and over again.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, implementations of
 * {@code Collator.compare(String, String)} can examine and process the strings
 * only until the first characters differ in order. This approach is
 * recommended if the strings are to be compared only once.
 * <p>
 * The following example shows how collation keys can be used to sort a
 * list of strings:
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create an array of CollationKeys for the Strings to be sorted.
 * Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
 * CollationKey[] keys = new CollationKey[3];
 * keys[0] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Tom&quot;);
 * keys[1] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Dick&quot;);
 * keys[2] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Harry&quot;);
 * sort(keys);
 * <br>
 * //...
 * <br>
 * // Inside body of sort routine, compare keys this way
 * if( keys[i].compareTo( keys[j] ) &gt; 0 )
 *    // swap keys[i] and keys[j]
 * <br>
 * //...
 * <br>
 * // Finally, when we've returned from sort.
 * System.out.println(keys[0].getSourceString());
 * System.out.println(keys[1].getSourceString());
 * System.out.println(keys[2].getSourceString());
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
