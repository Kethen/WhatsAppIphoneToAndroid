<p>
This package is provided only for compatibility reasons. It contains  a simplified
version of the java.security.cert package that was previously used by JSSE (Java SSL  package).
All applications that do not have to be compatible with older versions of JSSE (that is
before Java SDK 1.5) should only use java.security.cert.
