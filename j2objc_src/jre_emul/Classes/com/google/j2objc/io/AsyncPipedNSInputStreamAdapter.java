/**
 * An NSInputStream adapter piped to an NSOutputStream that in turn requests data via a {@link
 * java.io.OutputStream} asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>The main use case is to enable J2ObjC apps to obtain an NSInputStream that they can offer data
 * to and then pass the stream to another object that takes one. NSMutableURLRequest's
 * HTTPBodyStream is one such example.
 *
 * <p>The fundamental problem here is that streams in Java and streams in Objective-C (Foundation to
 * be more precise) have different designs. If you pipe an NSOutputStream to an NSInputStream, that
 * output stream requests data from you in an asynchronous manner using a callback, whereas Java's
 * OutputStream is synchronous. In addition, OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) assumes that all
 * the bytes will be written to in one go, whereas -[NSOutputStream read:maxLength:] returns the
 * actual bytes written.
 *
 * <p>To use this adapter, call the {@link #create(Delegate, int)} method. It returns a native
 * NSInputStream that you can pass to the target data consumer. To write data to this piped stream,
 * implement the sole delegate method, and use the suppiled Java OutputStream to offer data.
 *
 * <p>If you need to offer your data synchronously, you will need to consider using a pair of {@link
 * java.io.PipedInputStream} and {@link java.io.PipedOutputStream}, and offer the data using the
 * PipedOutputStream, and in your {@link Delegate#offerData(OutputStream)}, read data from the
 * PipedInputStream.
 *
 * <p>It is safe to close the provided OutputStream multiple times. It is also safe to send -close
 * to the underlying NSInputStream and NSOutputStream more than once. If the NSInputStream is closed
 * by the consuming end, the OutputStream will close soon after, and any unread data is discarded.
