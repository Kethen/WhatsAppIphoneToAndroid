Build Requirements
==================

This package must be built on an OS X system, with:

 * Xcode 7.1.1 or higher (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
 * JDK for OS X (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
 * Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)

Build Instructions
==================

The simplest way to build this package is to run "make dist" from its
top directory.  This builds the translator, JRE emulation and JUnit
libraries, and creates a "dist/" directory with commands, libraries
and include files.

Running "make" in each project directory will build just that project.
The J2ObjC translator is the main project, so running just "make" in
it will only build the translator.  While this is useful for developing
the translator, "make dist" is recommended for developers who just want
to use the tool.  Apache Maven is used to copy the translator's
dependent jars from the Maven Repository.

Running "make clean" removes all files created by the build, including
the "dist/" directory.
