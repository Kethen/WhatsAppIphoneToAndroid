When documenting the name of the corresponding formal parameter for a method
argument, prefer the `f(/* foo= */ value)` style of comment.

The problem with e.g. `f(false /* exclusive */)` is it can be interpreted
multiple ways:

*   Exclusiveness is false, so this is inclusive.
*   I am making this exclusive by setting the inclusiveness to false.

TIP: When you feel the need to add a parameter comment, consider whether the API
could be changed to be more self-documenting.
