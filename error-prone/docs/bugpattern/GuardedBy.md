The GuardedBy analysis checks that fields or methods annotated with
`@GuardedBy(lock)` are only accessed when the specified lock is held.

Example:

```java
import javax.annotation.concurrent.GuardedBy;

class Account {
  @GuardedBy("this")
  private int balance;

  public synchronized int getBalance() {
    return balance; // OK: implicit 'this' lock is held.
  }

  public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
    setBalance(balance - amount); // OK: implicit 'this' lock is held.
  }

  public void deposit(int amount) {
    setBalance(balance + amount); // ERROR: access to 'balance' not guarded by 'this'.
  }

  @GuardedBy("this")
  private void setBalance(int newBalance) {
    checkState(newBalance >= 0, "Balance cannot be negative.");
    balance = newBalance; // OK: 'this' must be held by caller of 'setBalance'.
  }
}
```

This above example uses implicit locks (via the 'synchronized' modifier). The
analysis also supports synchronized statements and java.util.concurrent locks.

## Basic Concepts

The analysis provides a way of associating members with locks. A member is a
field or a method. A lock can be the implicit lock of an object, or a
java.util.concurrent Lock.

An implicit lock is acquired using the built in synchronization features of the
language. Adding the 'synchronized' modifier to an instance method causes the
implicit lock of the enclosing instance to be acquired for the duration of the
method. Adding the 'synchronized' modifier to a static method is similar, except
the implicit lock of the Class object is acquired instead.

The Locks defined in java.util.concurrent are acquired with explicit
lock()/unlock() methods. The use of these methods in Java should always
correspond to a try/finally block, to ensure that the locks are released on all
execution paths.

## Reference

### Lock expression syntax

The following syntax can be used to describe a lock:

<table><tr><td><code>

this
</code></td><td>
The implicit object lock of the enclosing class.
</td></tr><tr><td><code>

ClassName.this
</code></td><td>
The implicit object lock of the enclosing class specified by ClassName.
(For inner classes, the ClassName.this designation allows you to specify which
'this' reference is intended.)

</td></tr><tr><td><code>
fieldName
this.fieldName
ClassName.this.fieldName
</code></td><td>
The final instance field specified by fieldName.

</td></tr><tr><td><code>
methodName()
this.methodName()
ClassName.this.methodName()
</code></td><td>
The instance method specified by methodName(). Methods called to return
locks should be deterministic.

</td></tr><tr><td><code>
ClassName.class
</code></td><td>
The implicit lock of specified Class object.

</td></tr><tr><td><code>
ClassName.fieldName
</code></td><td>
The static final field specified by fieldName.

</td></tr><tr><td><code>
ClassName.methodName()
</code></td><td>
The static method specified by methodName(). Methods called to return locks
should be deterministic.

</td></tr></table>

### Annotations

#### @GuardedBy

javax.annotation.concurrent.GuardedBy

The @GuardedBy annotation is used to document that a member (a field or a
method) can only be accessed when the specified lock is held.

@GuardedBy can be used with both implicit locks and java.util.concurrent Locks.

```java
final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

@GuardedBy("lock")
int x;

void m() {
  x++;  // error: access of 'x' not guarded by 'lock'
  lock.lock();
  try {
    x++;  // OK: guarded by 'lock'
  } finally {
    lock.unlock();
  }
}
```

#### @LockMethod

com.google.errorprone.bugpatterns.threadsafety.annotations.LockMethod

The method to which this annotation is applied acquires one or more locks. The
caller will hold the locks when the function finishes execution.

This annotation does not apply to implicit locks, which cannot be acquired
without being released in the same method.

```java
final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

@LockMethod("lock")
acquireLock() {}  // error: 'lock' was not acquired
```

#### @UnlockMethod

com.google.errorprone.bugpatterns.threadsafety.annotations.UnlockMethod

The method to which this annotation is applied releases one or more locks. The
caller must hold the locks when the function is entered, and will not hold them
when it completes.

This annotation does not apply to implicit locks, which cannot be released
without being acquired in the same method.

```java
final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

@GuardedBy("lock")
int x;

@UnlockMethod("lock")
releaseLock() {
  lock.unlock();
}

@LockMethod("lock")
acquireLock() {
  lock.lock();
}

public void increment() {
  acquireLock();
  try {
    x++;  // OK: 'lock' is held
  } finally {
    releaseLock();
  }
}
```

#### Limitations

Locks are resolved lexically

```java
class Transaction {
  @GuardedBy("this")
  int x;

  interface Handler {
    void apply();
  }

  public void handle() {
    runHandler(new Handler() {
      void apply() {
        x++;  // Error: access of 'x' not guarded by 'Transaction.this'
      }
    });
  }

  private synchronized void runHandler(Handler handler) {
    handler.apply();
  }
}
```

In this example, the analysis is unable to guarantee that callers of the Handler
created in 'handle' will be holding the required lock. The analysis is purely
intra-procedural, so it is unable to observe that the only caller (runHandler)
does in fact hold the necessary lock.

#### False negatives with aliasing

```java
class Names {
  @GuardedBy("this")
  List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

  public void addName(String name) {
    List<String> copyOfNames;
    synchronized (this) {
      copyOfNames = names;  // OK: access of 'names' guarded by 'this'
    }
    copyOfNames.add(name);  // should be an error: this access is not thread-safe!
  }
}
```

The analysis does not track aliasing, so it's possible to circumvent the safety
it provides by copying references to guarded members.

In the example, the guarded field 'names' can be accessed via a copy even if the
required lock is not held.
