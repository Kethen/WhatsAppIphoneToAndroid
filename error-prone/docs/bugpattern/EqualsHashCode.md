The contract for `Object.hashCode` states that if two objects are equal, then
calling the `hashCode()` method on each of the two objects must produce the same
result. Implementing `equals()` but not `hashCode()` causes broken behaviour
when trying to store the object in a collection.

See Effective Java ยง3.9 for more information and a discussion of how to
correctly implement `hashCode()`.
