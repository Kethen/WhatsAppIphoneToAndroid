The [Google Java Style Guide ยง6.1][style] requires that a method is marked with
the `@Override` annotation whenever it is legal. This includes a class method
overriding a superclass method, a class method implementing an interface method,
and an interface method respecifying a superinterface method.

Exception: `@Override` may be omitted when the parent method is `@Deprecated`.
